# web-dev

Learning neccessary tools (html, css, Javascript, React, request and response, routing, api fetching, sql, mongodb) for web development projects.

Most of the project can be run (if there is an app.js) by just entering
```shell
node app.js
nodemon app.js
```
either of the command will work.
